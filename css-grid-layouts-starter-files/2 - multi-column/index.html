        <h2>Ballon Magic</h2>
        <p>Forced perspective is a classic trick that anyone with a camera 
          can do but which can take a little bit of know-how to really get it looking 
          right. Forced perspective is where one object is closer to the camera lens and another further away, the objective being to make the closer object appear larger than it actually is in relation to the object which is further away, or vice versa.

          This is commonly done with fingers and bodies 
          (and in the case of the movie: hobbits and wizards), 
          classic examples being someone holding Stonehenge in the palm of their hand, pinching the moon between their fingers, or pushing the Leaning Tower of Piza into a more upright position.

        <h3>Ballon magic</h3>
        <p>The key thing to remember is to keep both the foreground and the background in focus (the effect wouldn’t work if either were out of focus). This is easier with wider angle lenses with a large depth of field. For narrower focal lengths it may be necessary to use a higher f-stop value to increase the depth of field. It also may take a bit of experimentation with the 
          distance between the lens and the object closer to it to get a convincing looking shot.</p>

        <h3>Road to freedom</h3>
        <p>Sometimes a lack of focus can help to make an image look more 
          convincing if a fake subject is a thing that’s out of focus. Even a simple cut-out l
          ike the alien below can appear to be a convincing visitation if staged correctly.

          The picture below was taken in a dark room with an open window behind
           the subject. The aperture was set to f1.8 
          and the exposure time was 8 minutes.</p>

        <h3>The clear blue</h3>
        <p>Levitation effects can be simply achieved not by using the force (or in this case a fork) but with a high shutter speed to capture objects or people mid-air. A high shutter speed will freeze the subject as it’s falling or rising, and give the impression that it is floating. The higher the shutter speed the better, 
          as it needs to be fast enough to freeze the subject in motion..</p>
